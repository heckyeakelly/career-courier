# Career Courier
A quiz for high school students to determine their best career match.

Adriana Baric, Euna Lim, Kelly Kou and Trang Do for [Hackville 2024](https://www.hackville.io/)

## Inspiration
During our ideation session, we discovered a shared experience among us: uncertainty about what to pursue after high school. We discussed the anxiety associated with changing majors, self-doubt, and regrets stemming from the decisions made by our young, 17-year-old brains.

Did you know that up to 70% of students in Ontario change their majors during their undergraduate degree? Students in this province collectively spend billions of dollars yearly on tuition for majors they won’t finish! It doesn’t have to be this way. That’s why we built Career Courier.


## What it does
Career Courier is an interactive career finder empowering high school students to make informed decisions about their professional futures. Created in response to paywalls and information overload on other sites, our web app delivers the necessary information and provides the resources to shape students' futures.

**What sets us apart?** 
- Facilitating connections with industry experts for students to gain real, human insight to the career students are interested in 
- Providing information in easily understandable formats using high-impact visuals
- Guiding you to the next stage through showcasing available programs 
- Eliminating the need for users to respond to lengthy and overly specific personality test questions


## How we built it
We created an interactive high-fidelity prototype using Figma to simulate an informative yet easy-to-follow user experience. This prototype was connected to a public domain using GoDaddy.


## Challenges we ran into
We intended to use Tempo to turn the wireframes into a dynamic front-end web application but weren’t able to adjust to the learning curve fast enough. 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have set a solid ground work for our design by doing research and competitor analysis before we got to design. It set us up for informed design decision making. We are also proud to implement good UX and UI practices into our design. 


## What we learned
We learned that just because a service is widely available, it doesn't automatically ensure a good user experience. Even with so many career-finding sites around, it surprised us to see the troubling stats of students struggling to plan their future. The existing sites seemed to overload users with information, adding to the anxiety students already feel. So, we decided to dig deeper into our research, aiming to create a platform that simplifies the process and truly helps students navigate their career paths with ease.


## What's next for Career Courier
We didn’t have time to implement any back-end data processing operations. If we did, we would have connected the professions from the Government of Canada’s JobBank via API, and written an algorithm to match the user’s quiz results to a job’s real attributes.
